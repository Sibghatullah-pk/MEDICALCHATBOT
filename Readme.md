Medical Chatbot
Welcome to the Medical Chatbot repository! This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide context-aware medical assistance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built with modern AI tools and cloud-ready architecture, itâ€™s a fun and helpful solution for basic healthcare queries when youâ€™re feeling "bimar" (sick) and a doctor isnâ€™t around!
About the Project
This Medical Chatbot leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver real-time, accurate responses. Whether youâ€™re asking about symptoms or seeking first-aid tips, it remembers your conversation to offer personalized advice. The project was developed over 2 weeks and showcases skills in Python, AI/ML, and cloud integration.
Features

Conversational Memory: Maintains context across questions (e.g., "Iâ€™m getting a fever" followed by "What do I do now?").
RAG with Pinecone: Retrieves relevant medical knowledge from a vector database.
Powered by Groq API: Utilizes advanced language models for natural responses.
Streamlit Interface: Offers an interactive and user-friendly frontend.
Cloud-Ready: Designed for deployment on platforms like Azure.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit
Backend/AI: LangChain, Groq API
